# Connect Room devices

Release draft — verify the Connector-owned USB steps on macOS and Windows
before publication.

Use **Escape Director firmware** to set up supported puzzle behavior in the app.
You do not need Arduino IDE or the SDK for this path. Choose **Your own firmware
(SDK)** only when you or your developer will write the controller's program.

## Before you start

Use Chrome on the computer that will operate the Room. Have your controller,
a USB data cable and Wi-Fi password ready. For a GIGA R1 WiFi, attach its external
antenna. Start on the same non-guest network as the Room Station; the devices
must be allowed to communicate with one another.

The current managed setup supports Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi and UNO R4 WiFi. Custom
SDK setup supports both boards. Keep the controller's prop outputs
disconnected while installing firmware and setting up wiring.

## 1. Connect Room Connector

1. Open your Room, choose **Edit**, then **Devices**.
2. Connect **Room Connector**. On a Mac, download it when prompted, move the app
   to **Applications**, and open it. Use the download for your Mac’s processor.
3. When Chrome asks to open Room Connector, allow it. Choose **Connect** in
   Room Connector's window.
4. If Chrome asks to access devices on your local network, allow access for
   Escape Director. This lets the page reach Room Connector on this computer.
5. Return to the Devices tab and confirm Room Connector says **Connected**.

Keep Room Connector running on this computer while operating the Room. You do
not need to reinstall it when you refresh the page.

## 2. Add and pair your controller

1. Choose **Add Integrated Device**, then **Escape Director firmware**.
2. Give the Device a recognizable name and choose **Add Device**.
3. Close Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor and any other program using the controller.
   Connect it by USB, choose **Pair controller**, and select the controller in
   the setup dialog when prompted. Room Connector handles the USB connection.
4. If the board needs firmware, choose **Install firmware** and select your board.
   Installation replaces its current program. Leave the cable connected while
   the controller restarts; setup continues to Wi-Fi by itself.
5. Follow the setup steps to choose a Wi-Fi network and enter its password.
   Use **Scan again** if needed, or **Enter name manually** for a hidden network.
6. Wait for setup to confirm that the controller reached the Room Station.

USB is needed for initial setup and firmware installation. After successful setup,
normal communication uses Wi-Fi. The controller still needs a suitable power source.

## 3. Configure the props

1. Add the props this controller will operate.
2. Choose each prop's behavior and assign the input and output channels to match
   the wiring. Several props can share one board using different channels.
3. For an ordered sequence, arrange the input rows in the order players must
   activate them.
4. Choose **Save and apply**, confirm, and wait for the controller to confirm
   the change. If the changes are already saved, the button says **Apply**.

If the app reports a problem, correct it before testing. Saving a configuration
in the app and applying it to the physical controller are separate steps.

## 4. Test before running a game

1. Turn on **Test mode**.
2. Operate each physical input and check the reported progress and actual output.
3. Reset the prop and try the inputs in a different order. Confirm each prop
   controls only its intended output.
4. Leave the inputs in their starting positions, reset the props, and turn off
   Test mode before changing configuration or starting a game.

Test mode does not run Automations or change Room Puzzle completion. Device
activity and diagnostics are separate from the Session Log. Use the board's
wiring instructions to connect and verify the intended loads before admitting guests.

## 5. Link props to Room Puzzles

1. In a prop's **Linked Puzzle** selector, choose the Puzzle it represents.
   Different props can link to different Puzzles.
2. Start a bench game from the Room Dashboard. Complete the Puzzle from the
   Dashboard and check that the linked prop completes.
3. Finish the game, then choose **Reset Room**. Start another bench game and
   solve the physical prop. Check that its Puzzle completes once.
4. Finish and reset again. Check controller power-cycle recovery before using
   the Room with guests.

A linked Puzzle handles both directions without reciprocal Automations. Use
Automations when completion should also trigger other actions, such as audio.

During a running game, the same controller can show **Reconnecting…** while
recovering, then resume control automatically. Commands missed during the gap
are not repeated. If **Device control paused** remains, check the controller
and any reported problem before choosing **Resume device control**.

## Updating Room Connector

**Update required** means a feature needs a newer Connector. **Update available**
means a newer version is ready to download, but your current Connector can still
operate the Room. Finish any running game before updating.

On a Mac, quit Room Connector, replace the existing app in Applications with the
new download, then open it again. Restarting the old app does not update it.
Keep your existing setup; you should not need to pair again.

## If setup is interrupted

Keep the same Device and reopen its **Controller setup**. Confirm Room Connector
is running on this computer, then reconnect the USB controller if requested.
Close other programs using the USB connection before retrying. Do not add a
second Device or reinstall firmware merely because a connection attempt failed.

Joining Wi-Fi and reaching the Room Station are separate steps. If Wi-Fi connects
but setup cannot reach the station, confirm both use the same network and that
it allows devices to communicate. Moving a controller from another computer also
requires updating its Room Station connection. Use **Reconnect to Room Station**
if setup offers it, and wait for confirmation before testing the prop again.

If you denied Chrome's local-network permission, open the site's permissions,
allow local-network access for Escape Director, then reload and reconnect Room
Connector. If your organization manages that setting, ask its administrator for
access. Keep the browser and firewall protections enabled.

## Existing HTTP and MQTT devices

Choose **Existing device** to keep a device’s current firmware and map its
messages to Escape Director. Follow [Connect existing devices](connect-existing-devices.md).

## Using your own firmware

Choose **Your own firmware (SDK)** when you or your developer write the
controller's program. Its props and wiring are defined in the firmware, not in
the app. Follow [Build Your Own Controller](../../build-your-rooms/build-your-own-controller.md)
to pair it, save its props and update it later.
